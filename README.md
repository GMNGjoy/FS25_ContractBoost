# Contract Boost for FS25
Farming Simulator 25 changed contracts across the board - some things are for the better, and other things are either frustrating or just don't make sense. This mod aims to allow the player to activate / alter the contract system to their needs, allowing customization of the number of contracts available, the limit on active contracts, the reward rate for each type of contract (or all at once), as well as enabling many more contract tools than are currently allowed.
